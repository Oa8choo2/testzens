# zstd

## Description

Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression 
ratios. It offers a very wide range of compression/speed trade-off, while being 
backed by a very fast decoder. It also offers a special mode for small data, 
called dictionary compression, and can create dictionaries from any sample set.

Zstandard is a lossless data compression algorithm developed by Yann Collet at Facebook.
Zstd is the corresponding reference implementation in C, released as open-source
software on 31 August 2016. The algorithm was published in 2018 as, which also defines
an associated media type "application/zstd", filename extension "zst", and HTTP
content encoding "zstd".
